- **Dividers**: Subtle ornamental elements inspired by tattoo flash

### Brand Voice

✅ "Greek for Glory. Worn with honor. Backed by faith."

### What NOT to Say
❌ Church language (blessed, anointed, walking in faith)
❌ Cheesy faith phrases (God's got this!, Let your light shine!)
❌ Hype/influencer speak (fire emoji, let's goooo, drip)
